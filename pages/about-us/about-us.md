## Introduction <i class="fa fa-user fa-1x"></i>
We are Saurabh & Ramya. We are an Indian travel couple based in California. <br>

Ramya was born in Telangana (South India). Saurabh was born in Varanasi (North India). We are a two state couple. <br>

We both moved to the USA in 2017 to do our masters at Texas A&M University as complete strangers. Ramya was doing MS in Management Information Systems and Saurabh was doing MS in Computer Science. We both met in our 2nd semester of our masters and fell in love. We both are Software Engineers by profession. <br>

We initially lived in Austin, Texas. We explored the better part of the USA in the last 4 years. We loved California during one of our trips so we moved to California at the beginning of 2022. <br>

We are nature nerds, travel addicts, and foodies. We travel whenever we get a chance. We started this account in September 2022 to show this world through our experiences and inspire more people to get out & explore this beautiful world. Ramya manages our instagram travel account. <br>

We are pizza with sunset or sushi by the waterfall kind of people. We both are foodies and love cooking. Even though we are from different parts of India, we have similar taste in food. Whenever we are travelling, we try to pack breakfast/lunch and have it with a beautiful view. By the way, Saurabh makes killer desi non veg dishes ü§§ <br>

Ramya speaks English, Telugu, Hindi. Saurabh speaks English and Hindi. We both speak in Hindi or English at home. Saurabh still needs to learn Telugu (knows 10 words and most favorite one being sare sare üòÇ) <br>

Travelling every country is on our bucket list. Join us on our adventure ‚ù§Ô∏è <br>
